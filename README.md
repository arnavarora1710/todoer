### concurrent task graph in c++
want to practice modern c++ and experiment with concurrency in action.

idea is to build a PEMDAS interpreter: represent arithmetic expressions as a task graph and run nodes independently in parallel with a smart scheduler.

want to get practice with:
- C++17/20 concurrency features (futures, promises, atomic/condition vars)
- low latency coroutines that wait on dependent results
- maybe some symbolic computation stuff
